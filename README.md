At the end of this project, I achieved several outcomes and gained valuable knowledge and skills. Here's what I learned and accomplished:

1. __Proficiency with AutoGluon:__
I gained hands-on experience using the AutoGluon library to train and optimize machine learning models for tabular prediction tasks. This enhanced my understanding of AutoGluon's capabilities and its application in real-world scenarios.

2. __Model Training and Optimization:__
I learned how to train multiple iterations of models using AutoGluon, explored different hyperparameters and optimization strategies to improve model performance. This deepened my knowledge of model training techniques and the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model outcomes.

3. __Data Preparation and Analysis:__
Working with the Bike Sharing Demand dataset, I gained insights into data preparation techniques specific to tabular data. This included handling categorical variables, feature engineering, and exploring time-based features. I also analyzed the dataset to identify patterns and relationships that could be leveraged for better predictions.

4. __Kaggle Competition Participation:__
I submitted multiple entries to the Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle, gaining experience in the competition setting. I evaluated my model's performance against other participants and strived for a competitive rank. This experience enhanced my understanding of real-world data challenges and the importance of model performance in a competitive environment.

5. __Report and Public Showcase:__
As part of the project, I completed a report summarizing my findings, insights, and approaches. This report can be shared publicly on Kaggle or my personal page, providing an opportunity to showcase my work and communicate my strategies and achievements to a wider audience.
6. __Proficiency with AWS EC2:__
As part of the project I have used advanced AWS Machine Learning Cloud Instances like Sagemaker, Jumpstart and Data Wrangler

Overall, this project equipped me with practical skills in using AutoGluon for tabular prediction tasks, enhanced my understanding of data preparation and analysis, and provided valuable experience in participating in Kaggle competitions and sharing my work with the data science community.
